#Deviant

A little homemade roguelike written in C++ and SDL2.

TODO:

- The damn game
- Make a real multiplatform Makefile
- Test it on Linux and Windows
- Sounds, music... etc will come after the base game

DONE:

- Resizable multiplatform window (SDL)
- User input
- True random cave generation (walls and ground for now)
- Movable player
- Main menu (with no options yet)
- init.txt config file to use a custom tileset (aka stolen from Dwarf Fortress)
